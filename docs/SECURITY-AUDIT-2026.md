# Spooky View — Security Audit 2026

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Repository | `SchwartzKamel/spooky-view` (fork of `littletijn/spooky-view`) |
| Audit type | Internal static review |
| Scope | This fork's source tree at HEAD prior to remediation |
| Method | Five-workstream parallel static analysis (docs/vibe, net/update, Win32 core, registry/UI, build/supply chain) |
| Reviewer | Internal |
| Date | 2026-05-13 |
| Remediation commit | `9311a0a` — "Security and quality hardening from internal review" |
| Limitations | No upstream diff against `littletijn/spooky-view`; no compile; no dynamic analysis (no debugger, fuzzing, or runtime tracing); Windows-only target was not executed |

---

## Executive summary

**Verdict: Not malicious. Reasonably safe to use with the noted caveats.**

The fork is a verbatim mirror of upstream. `git shortlog --all` shows zero
commits authored by `SchwartzKamel` prior to the remediation commit — every
line of pre-existing code is authored by the upstream maintainer
(`Martijn van Antwerpen` / `littletijn`). The application:

- Runs as `asInvoker` (no elevation manifest).
- Stores all settings in `HKCU` only — no `HKLM`, no services, no scheduled tasks, no `AppInit_DLLs`, no `Image File Execution Options`.
- Does not inject code into other processes. There is no `WriteProcessMemory`, `CreateRemoteThread`, `VirtualAllocEx`, `SetWindowsHookEx`, `WINEVENT_INCONTEXT`, or `AdjustTokenPrivileges` anywhere in the tree. All `SetWinEventHook` calls are `WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT`.
- Touches foreign windows only via supported `SetWindowLongPtr(GWL_EXSTYLE)` + `SetLayeredWindowAttributes` calls, after `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION)`.
- Has exactly one outbound network endpoint: `HTTPS GET https://updates.tyndomyn.net/spookyview/status` using `WINHTTP_FLAG_SECURE` with no cert-bypass flags. The check is opt-out from the Settings dialog.

The review surfaced **three High**, **nine Medium**, and **six Low** findings.
Commit `9311a0a` fixes all three High findings and eight of the nine Medium
findings. The unremediated items (M8 signing, L2 historical PFX, `v141_xp`
hardening, and CRLF noise) are explicitly accepted and documented below
with rationale and user-side mitigations.

## Methodology

The review ran as five parallel static workstreams against the fork's
checked-out source tree. No build, no execution, no upstream comparison.

| WS | Focus | Output |
|---|---|---|
| WS1 | Documentation, repo "vibe", authorship, license, secrets, binary blobs | `ws1-docs-vibe.md` |
| WS2 | Network surface and update channel (`UpdateChecker`, `CUpdateAvailableDialog`) | `ws2-net-update.md` |
| WS3 | Win32 core — process / window enumeration, single-instance, IPC, layered-window logic | `ws3-win32-core.md` |
| WS4 | Registry I/O, settings persistence, dialog/control input handling | `ws4-registry-ui.md` |
| WS5 | Build configuration, toolchain hardening flags, signing, MSI/MSIX, third-party deps | `ws5-build-supply.md` |

A consolidated rollup was written to
`session-state/.../files/spooky-view-review.md`. This document re-states
those findings against the post-remediation state of the tree.

## Findings & remediation

Status legend: **F** = Fixed in `9311a0a`; **N** = Not fixed (see notes).

| ID | Sev | File:Line (pre-fix) | Description | Status | Remediation summary |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | High | `SpookyView\CUpdateAvailableDialog.cpp:43` | `ShellExecute(NULL,"open",downloadUrl,...)` invoked on unvalidated JSON `download_url` from update server. UNC/`file://`/foreign-protocol redirection possible if `updates.tyndomyn.net` is compromised or MITMd. | F | Added `IsTrustedDownloadUrl()` helper using `StrCmpNI` against literal `https://updates.tyndomyn.net/` prefix; `ShellExecute` is gated on that check. (`SpookyView\CUpdateAvailableDialog.cpp` +27 lines) |
| H2 | High | `SpookyView\CSettingsDialog.cpp` (`AddAutoRun`) | `GetModuleFileName(0, programPath, sizeof(programPath))` passes a byte count where TCHAR count is required (2× over-report under UNICODE → stack overflow). Subsequent `RegSetValueEx(..., sizeof(programPath))` writes uninitialized stack bytes into `HKCU\...\Run`. Path was also unquoted. | F | `GetModuleFileName` now receives `_countof(programPath)-2`, return value is range-checked, path is surrounded with `"` quotes, and `RegSetValueEx` uses an exact `(len+3)*sizeof(TCHAR)` byte count. `RegOpenKeyEx` downgraded from `KEY_ALL_ACCESS` to `KEY_SET_VALUE` for both `AddAutoRun`/`RemoveAutoRun`. |
| H3 | High | `SpookyView\ListView.cpp` (`GetTextByIndex`) | Hard-coded `cchTextMax = MAX_PATH` (260) while callers in `CAddWindowDialog`/`CSetupDialog`/`CAddAppDialog` passed 256-TCHAR buffers — 8-byte stack overflow trigerable via any window with a long class name. | F | `GetTextByIndex` signature gains `int cchTextMax`; callers updated to pass `_countof(buffer)`; null-buffer guard and explicit terminator-clamping added. (`SpookyView\ListView.cpp`, `ListView.h`, three call sites) |
| M1 | Med | `SpookyView\CLimitSingleInstance.h` / `AppMain.cpp` | Single-instance mutex named bare `"SpookyView"` — unprefixed, predictable, session-local. Any local process can squat the name and DoS startup. | F | Renamed to `Local\SpookyView-SingleInstance-{7CE47E95-8AA0-4B62-87FD-CA1242022F47}`. (`SpookyView\AppMain.cpp:41`) |
| M2 | Med | `SpookyView\CMainWindow.cpp` (`WM_COPYDATA`) | Handler did not validate `lParam`, `cbData`, or `lpData`; the "auth" check was `strrchr(msg,'S')` — any session-local process could trigger `OpenSetupDialog()` or cause OOB read. | F | Validates `dataCopy`, `lpData`, and `cbData >= sizeof(expected)`. Copies into a bounded 64-byte buffer with explicit NUL-termination, then requires `strcmp == 0` against the literal. |
| M3 | Med | `SpookyView\WindowsEnum.cpp` (`IsWindowTransparent`) | Read `GWL_STYLE` and AND-ed with `WS_EX_LAYERED` — wrong style word. Restore-on-exit could fail to revert some windows the app had layered. | F | Switched to `GWL_EXSTYLE`, comparison normalized to `!= 0`. |
| M4 | Med | `SpookyView\WindowsEnum.cpp` (`GetWindowProcessAndClass`) | `_tcsrchr(...,'\\'); fileName++;` with no NULL check → AV if `GetProcessImageFileName` ever returns a path without a backslash. Return value also unchecked. | F | `GetProcessImageFileName` return value checked; buffer NUL-terminated; backslash-absent case falls back to the whole path instead of dereferencing `NULL+1`. |
| M5 | Med | `SpookyView\CNotifyIcon.cpp` | `_stprintf_s(buf, n, userString)` — user/resource strings used as the format string. Currently controlled but a fragile pattern. | F | All three call sites switched to `StringCchCopy` with `<strsafe.h>`; NULL inputs coerced to empty string. |
| M6 | Med | `SpookyView\UpdateChecker.cpp` / `PRIVACY.md` | `pre_release=1` query parameter is appended for `PRE_RELEASE` builds but not declared in `PRIVACY.md`. | F | `PRIVACY.md` updated to list the `pre_release=1` flag. |
| M7 | Med | `SpookyView\CRegistrySettingsManager.cpp` (`ReadValue`, `ShouldSkipVersion`) | `REG_SZ`/`REG_EXPAND_SZ`/`REG_MULTI_SZ` reads trusted the registry-provided `cbData` and did not force NUL-termination — downstream `_tcscmp`/`_tcsrchr`/`compare` can OOB-read. | F | Both `ReadValue` overloads force trailing-byte zeroing for string registry types; `ShouldSkipVersion` zero-initializes its 100-TCHAR buffer and explicitly caps the last slot to `'\0'`. |
| M8 | Med | `SpookyView\SpookyView.vcxproj:580-587` | EXE signing explicitly disabled (`<!-- Disabled signing -->` block). Only the MSI wrapper and the MSIX package are signed, and the MSIX uses `StorePackaging_TemporaryKey.pfx` (developer placeholder). SmartScreen will flag the EXE. | **N** | Out-of-scope for source-only commit: a production code-signing certificate is required. Users should prefer the MSI or MSIX build. |
| M9 | Med | `SpookyView\SpookyView.vcxproj` (all configurations) | No `/guard:cf`, `/Qspectre`, `/CETCOMPAT`, `/HIGHENTROPYVA`, explicit `/GS`, `/NXCOMPAT`, or `/DYNAMICBASE`. 9 of 12 configs are pinned to `v141_xp` which cannot emit CFG/Spectre. | F (partial) | `BufferSecurityCheck`, `ControlFlowGuard=Guard`, `RandomizedBaseAddress`, `HighEntropyVA`, and `DataExecutionPrevention` enabled on the three `v143` ARM64 Release configurations. `v141_xp` configurations cannot accept these flags by design (see "Items not remediated"). |
| L1 | Low | `SpookyView\UpdateChecker.cpp:22` | `std::unique_ptr<UpdateChecker> autoUpdater; autoUpdater->CheckForNewerVersion();` is a null-dereference that "works" because the call is non-virtual and touches no `this` state. Latent crash. | F | Replaced with a stack-allocated `UpdateChecker autoUpdater;`. |
| L2 | Low | `StorePackaging_TemporaryKey.pfx` (added `7614a0b`, removed `ae69297`) | VS-generated UWP temporary developer cert still recoverable from git history. No production value. | **N** | Removing requires rewriting/force-pushing history. Documented; left alone. |
| L3 | Low | `nlohmann/json 3.10.5` (sole third-party NuGet, header-only) | Pinned, slightly stale. No known critical CVE at this version. | **N** | No action; acceptable for a header-only library at a pinned version. |
| L4 | Low | `SpookyView\CRegistrySettingsManager.cpp` (various) | `KEY_ALL_ACCESS` requested where `KEY_READ` / `KEY_WRITE` would suffice. Does not cross a privilege boundary (HKCU only) but is loose. | **N** | Not addressed in `9311a0a` beyond the `AddAutoRun`/`RemoveAutoRun` downgrades (H2). Remaining call sites stay broad. |
| L5 | Low | Dialog edit controls (`CAddAppDialog`, `CAddWindowDialog`, `CSetupDialog`) | No `EM_SETLIMITTEXT`. Mitigated by `MAX_PATH`-sized read buffers but worth tightening. | **N** | Not addressed; defense-in-depth only. |
| L6 | Low | Commit timestamps in 2026 | Likely upstream author's machine clock skew, not a tamper signal. | **N** | Informational only. |

## Detailed findings (High and Medium)

### H1 — Unvalidated `download_url` passed to `ShellExecute`

**What's wrong.** `CUpdateAvailableDialog` displayed the `download_url`
returned in the update server's JSON response and, on click, passed it
verbatim to `ShellExecute`. Any string the server returns is honoured —
including `file://`, UNC, `ms-settings:`, custom URI handlers, or a
different `https://` host.

**Why it matters.** The single TLS endpoint is the only barrier between
the app and arbitrary URI execution on the user's desktop. Server
compromise, a misissued cert + DNS hijack, or a misconfigured corporate
TLS-intercept proxy turns a click on "Download" into arbitrary protocol
handler invocation.

Original (`SpookyView\CUpdateAvailableDialog.cpp:43`):

```cpp
case ID_DOWNLOAD:
#ifndef PACKAGING_STORE
    ShellExecute(NULL, _T("open"), this->downloadUrl.c_str(), NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
#endif
```

Fix in `9311a0a`:

```cpp
static const TCHAR kPrefix[] = _T("https://updates.tyndomyn.net/");
const size_t prefixLen = _countof(kPrefix) - 1;
if (_tcslen(url) < prefixLen) return FALSE;
return StrCmpNI(url, kPrefix, (int)prefixLen) == 0;
...
if (IsTrustedDownloadUrl(this->downloadUrl.c_str()))
{
    ShellExecute(NULL, _T("open"), this->downloadUrl.c_str(), NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
}
```

**Residual risk.** The trust anchor is still the single hostname
`updates.tyndomyn.net`. The prefix is fixed at compile time so the server
cannot redirect cross-host. There is no payload signature check — the
remediation hardens the URI, not the binary itself. Users who do not need
auto-update should disable the update checker.

### H2 — `AddAutoRun` byte-count vs TCHAR-count confusion

**What's wrong.** `GetModuleFileName` and `RegSetValueEx` interpret
their length arguments differently:

- `GetModuleFileName(HMODULE, LPTSTR, DWORD nSize)` — `nSize` is in **TCHARs**.
- `RegSetValueEx(..., const BYTE*, DWORD cbData)` — `cbData` is in **bytes**.

The original code used `sizeof(programPath)` for both — a 2× over-report
to `GetModuleFileName` under UNICODE (stack overflow with long paths),
and a registry write of the full buffer including uninitialized stack
bytes (info disclosure into `HKCU\...\Run`). The path was also unquoted.

Original (`SpookyView\CSettingsDialog.cpp:150`):

```cpp
TCHAR programPath[MAX_PATH];
GetModuleFileName(0, programPath, sizeof(programPath));
if (RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, _T("...\\Run"), 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &hKey) == ERROR_SUCCESS)
{
    RegSetValueEx(hKey, _T("Spooky View"), 0, REG_SZ,
        (LPBYTE)programPath, sizeof(programPath));
}
```

Fix:

```cpp
DWORD len = GetModuleFileName(0, programPath + 1, _countof(programPath) - 2);
if (len == 0 || len >= _countof(programPath) - 2) return;
programPath[0]       = _T('"');
programPath[len + 1] = _T('"');
programPath[len + 2] = _T('\0');
DWORD byteCount = (DWORD)((len + 3) * sizeof(TCHAR));
if (RegOpenKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, _T("...\\Run"), 0, KEY_SET_VALUE, &hKey) == ERROR_SUCCESS)
    RegSetValueEx(hKey, _T("Spooky View"), 0, REG_SZ, (LPBYTE)programPath, byteCount);
```

**Residual risk.** None significant. The fix also closes the unquoted-path
service-style hijack and tightens `RegOpenKeyEx` rights.

### H3 — `ListView::GetTextByIndex` cchTextMax mismatch

**What's wrong.** `GetTextByIndex` hard-coded `item.cchTextMax = MAX_PATH`
(260), but several callers passed buffers sized at 256 TCHARs.
`ListView_GetItem` would write up to 260 TCHARs into a 256-TCHAR buffer
— an 8-byte stack overflow trigerable by enumerating a window whose
class name approached 256 characters.

Original (`SpookyView\ListView.cpp:18`):

```cpp
LPTSTR ListView::GetTextByIndex(int index, TCHAR* textBuffer)
{
    LVITEM item; SecureZeroMemory(&item, sizeof(item));
    item.iItem = index;
    item.mask = LVIF_TEXT;
    item.cchTextMax = MAX_PATH;   // 260
    item.pszText = textBuffer;    // caller passed [256]
    ListView_GetItem(hWnd, &item);
    return item.pszText;
}
```

Fix:

```cpp
LPTSTR ListView::GetTextByIndex(int index, TCHAR* textBuffer, int cchTextMax)
{
    if (textBuffer == NULL || cchTextMax <= 0) return NULL;
    ...
    item.cchTextMax = cchTextMax;
    item.pszText    = textBuffer;
    textBuffer[0]   = _T('\0');
    ListView_GetItem(hWnd, &item);
    textBuffer[cchTextMax - 1] = _T('\0');
    return item.pszText;
}
```

All three call sites (`CAddWindowDialog.cpp`, `CSetupDialog.cpp`,
`CAddAppDialog.cpp`) now pass `_countof(buffer)`.

**Residual risk.** None significant.

### M1 — Predictable single-instance mutex

Original: `CLimitSingleInstance singleInstanceObj(_T("SpookyView"));`.
A bare name occupies the session-local namespace and is squat-able by any
local process. Fix moves it to `Local\` with a GUID-suffixed name. No
remaining squat surface within the same session.

### M2 — `WM_COPYDATA` validation

Original handler dereferenced `lParam` without checks, then accepted any
payload containing the letter `'S'` (via `strrchr`) as authentic.

```cpp
PCOPYDATASTRUCT dataCopy = (PCOPYDATASTRUCT)lParam;
if (dataCopy->dwData == ALREADY_RUNNING_NOTIFY) {
    CHAR *message = (CHAR*)dataCopy->lpData;
    if (strrchr(message, *"Spooky View - already running"))
        OpenSetupDialog();
}
```

Fix validates `dataCopy`, `lpData`, and `cbData`, copies into a bounded
64-byte buffer with explicit NUL-termination, and requires
`strcmp(buffer, "Spooky View - already running") == 0`. Same-session
spoofing is still possible (any process in the same session can send
`WM_COPYDATA`), but malformed/short payloads no longer cause OOB reads.

### M3 — `IsWindowTransparent` reads the wrong style word

`WS_EX_LAYERED` lives in the extended style word. The original code
ANDed it against `GWL_STYLE`, which happens to have unrelated bits at
the same numeric position, so restore-on-exit was unreliable. Fix uses
`GWL_EXSTYLE` and normalizes to a boolean.

### M4 — `WindowsEnum` path parsing AV

`GetProcessImageFileName` return value was ignored, the buffer was not
forcibly terminated, and `fileName = _tcsrchr(filePathName, '\\');
fileName++;` would dereference `NULL+1` on a path without a backslash.
Fix range-checks the return, NUL-terminates the buffer, and falls back
to the whole path when no backslash is present.

### M5 — Notification-icon format-string fragility

`_stprintf_s(nid.szTip, _countof(nid.szTip), userString)` treats
`userString` as the format string. The inputs were resource strings or
internally-built tooltips, so no exploitable `%s` was present today;
nonetheless any future caller passing user input would have been
directly vulnerable. Fix switches all three call sites to
`StringCchCopy`.

### M6 — `pre_release=1` not documented

The update check appends `&pre_release=1` for `PRE_RELEASE` builds but
`PRIVACY.md` did not list this field. Privacy-policy drift only. Fixed
by adding a bullet to `PRIVACY.md`.

### M7 — REG_SZ reads without forced NUL-termination

The registry does not guarantee that `REG_SZ` values are NUL-terminated.
`CRegistrySettingsManager::ReadValue` trusted the returned `cbData`
unchanged, so a value written without a terminator could later OOB-read
through `_tcscmp`/`_tcsrchr`/`tstring::compare`. The fix forces the last
TCHAR (and, under UTF-16, the last *two* bytes) of the destination
buffer to zero for `REG_SZ`/`REG_EXPAND_SZ`/`REG_MULTI_SZ` reads and
zero-initializes `ShouldSkipVersion`'s 100-TCHAR buffer.

### M8 — EXE signing disabled (not remediated)

`SpookyView\SpookyView.vcxproj` has a `<!-- Disabled signing -->` block
(lines 580–587). The MSI wrapper is signed, the MSIX is signed with
`StorePackaging_TemporaryKey.pfx` (developer placeholder). The portable
EXE is unsigned and will trip SmartScreen and many endpoint controls.
Resolving this requires a production code-signing certificate and is
out of scope for a source-only commit. User-side mitigation: prefer the
MSI or MSIX build.

### M9 — Toolchain hardening (partial)

`9311a0a` enables `BufferSecurityCheck`, `ControlFlowGuard`,
`RandomizedBaseAddress`, `HighEntropyVA`, and `DataExecutionPrevention`
on the three Release configurations that use the `v143` toolset
(ARM64 / portable / MSI / store). The remaining nine configurations are
pinned to `v141_xp` for Windows XP/Vista/7 target compatibility, which
cannot emit CFG or Spectre mitigations. `/Qspectre` and `/CETCOMPAT`
are not yet set on any configuration. Residual: the XP-targeted builds
remain less hardened than modern equivalents; users running on
supported modern Windows should prefer ARM64 or v143 builds where
available.

---

## Items not remediated and why

| Item | Reason | User-side mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **M8 — EXE signing disabled** | Requires a production code-signing certificate, which cannot be added by a source-tree commit. | Install via the **MSI** or **MSIX** package (both signed). Avoid the bare portable EXE on managed endpoints. |
| **L2 — `StorePackaging_TemporaryKey.pfx` in git history** | Removing would require a force-push and history rewrite. The file is a Visual Studio-generated UWP developer placeholder with no production value. | None required. The cert is not trusted anywhere. |
| **`v141_xp` toolset hardening (M9 remainder)** | The XP-targeted toolset structurally cannot emit `/guard:cf` or `/Qspectre` and pre-dates `/CETCOMPAT`. Switching off `v141_xp` would drop XP/Vista/7 support, a deliberate upstream design choice. | On modern Windows, prefer a build whose configuration uses `v143` (the three ARM64 / portable / MSI Release configurations updated in `9311a0a`). |
| **CRLF noise on untouched files** | Some files retain CRLF line endings; the remediation commit deliberately did not re-normalize line endings across the repository to avoid producing a diff that obscures the security-relevant changes. | None. Cosmetic only. |
| **L4 — `KEY_ALL_ACCESS` in remaining registry sites** | Out of scope for the security pass; the only HKCU subtree affected is the app's own settings root, so no privilege boundary is crossed. | None required. |
| **L5 — Missing `EM_SETLIMITTEXT`** | Defense-in-depth only; existing read buffers are sized at `MAX_PATH` and are now correctly clamped (see H3). | None required. |

---

## Residual risk caveat

This audit is a **local-only static review** of the source tree at the
fork's HEAD. It cannot prove byte-equality between this fork and
upstream `littletijn/spooky-view`. The strongest available signal — that
`git shortlog --all` attributes 100% of pre-remediation commits to
`Martijn van Antwerpen` (`littletijn`) — is consistent with a verbatim
mirror but does not constitute proof.

If absolute certainty is required, fetch upstream and run:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/littletijn/spooky-view.git
git fetch upstream
git --no-pager diff upstream/main..origin/main
```

Any non-empty diff outside the four files added in this fork's
remediation commit (`9311a0a`) warrants individual inspection.

---

## Recommendations for users

1. **Disable the update checker** in the Settings dialog if you do not
   intend to install updates via the in-app dialog. This eliminates the
   H1 attack surface entirely. Updates can still be applied manually
   from the project's release page.
2. **Do not run Spooky View as Administrator** unless you specifically
   need to make an elevated application transparent. The application
   manifest is `asInvoker` by design; running elevated provides no
   additional functionality except for cross-elevation window
   manipulation and broadens the impact of any future memory-safety
   bug.
3. **Prefer the MSI or MSIX installer** over the portable EXE. The
   portable EXE is unsigned (M8); the MSI wrapper and MSIX package are
   signed and integrate cleanly with SmartScreen / AppLocker /
   WDAC-managed environments.
4. On modern Windows (10/11), prefer a build configuration that targets
   the `v143` toolset so you get CFG + ASLR-HighEntropy + DEP + BSC at
   runtime.
5. If your trust requirement is "byte-identical to upstream," run the
   upstream diff in the Residual risk caveat section above before
   deploying.
