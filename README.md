### Github
https://github.com/littletijn/spooky-view/releases

When downloading from Github, make sure to choose the correct version.

- For 64-bits Windows, download the x64 version to make sure that x64 based apps can also be set transparent.
- For 32-bits Windows, download the x86 version. Use this version only on 32-bits computers. 
- For Windows 10 or 11 Arm-based PCs, download the ARM64 version for the best performance. 

## Known issues
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) apps cannot be set transparent.
- When stopping Spooky View, some apps will not return opaque. Restart the affected apps to revert them.
- Only when Spooky View is run as administrator will it be able to make high privileges app transparent, like Windows Task Mananger.

## Logging & Diagnostics

- Log file: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpookyView\spookyview.log`. The log rotates at
  ~1 MiB to `spookyview.log.old`. It is written locally and is never
  uploaded anywhere by the app.
- On an unhandled crash, a minidump named
  `spookyview-crash-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-PID.dmp` is written to the same
  directory by an internal Vectored Exception Handler. Windows Error
  Reporting (WER) `LocalDumps` can additionally be enabled as a backup.

### Troubleshooting

- If a dialog doesn't open or the app exits unexpectedly, check
  `spookyview.log` and any `.dmp` file in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SpookyView\`.

## FAQ
